# P2 Employ Python Data Structures, Notebooks & Engage

## Objectives
This exercise is used to reinforce key Python concepts including data structures, functions, and more. It's open book, open-note, and you're encouraged to see how you can use your resources to solve specific coding issues that may arise as a data analyst. It offers practice with web-enabled Jupyter notebooks and lays some important foundations for web mining.

## Assignment Overview

2. We will clone the repo to our IDE.
3. We will work through the Jupyter Notebooks and finish all challenges.
4. We will use Git commands to commit and push changes to our GitHub.
5. We will export the Jupyter Notebooks as HTML for submission.
